# OculusPrimeSwitcher

## Introduction

OculusPrimeSwitcher is a utility designed to bypass the official OculusDash.exe and boot directly into SteamVR. This tool is especially useful for users who primarily use SteamVR and want to optimize their VR experience by eliminating unnecessary processes.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have both Oculus and SteamVR installed on your machine.
2. Backup the original `OculusDash.exe` from the Oculus installation directory.
3. Clone or download the OculusPrimeSwitcher repository.
4. Build the project to produce the `OculusDash.exe` executable.
5. Replace the original `OculusDash.exe` with the one from OculusPrimeSwitcher.
6. When you log into either Oculus Link or Air Link, the new `OculusDash.exe` will automatically start, bypassing the official OculusDash and launching SteamVR directly.
7. The utility will automatically detect the necessary paths for Oculus and SteamVR.

## About

OculusPrimeSwitcher is a project created by Eliminater74. It is inspired by the [OculusKiller](https://github.com/LibreQuest/OculusKiller) project but has been written from scratch to be better optimized for performance and to achieve the desired actions of booting directly to SteamVR. The primary goal is to enhance the VR experience by reducing unnecessary overhead and providing a seamless transition to SteamVR.
